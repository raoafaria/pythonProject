Algorithm Performance and Sorting Benchmark

This repository contains Python scripts to benchmark the performance of an algorithm with nested loops and implement Merge Sort. It includes the following features:

1) Benchmarking the performance of an algorithm with time complexity O(nÂ²) using the compute_growth(n) function.
2) Measuring execution time for various input sizes and plotting the results.
3) Fitting a polynomial curve to the execution time data and analyzing the time complexity.
4) Implementing Merge Sort and testing it on a sample array.
5) Menu Prompt: A menu prompt allows users to choose between benchmarking the algorithm or sorting an array using Merge Sort.

Files
algorithm.py: Contains the implementation for the performance benchmarking, plotting, Merge Sort, and menu prompt functionality.

How to Run
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/raoafaria/pythonProject.git
cd pythonProject

Run the script:
python algorithm.py

Follow the on-screen menu prompts to:
Select an option:
1. Run Original Function
2. Run Modified Function
3. Run Merge Sort
4. Exit

Output
Graph: A plot showing the execution time vs. input size.
Sorted Array: Merge Sort will sort the test array and output the sorted result.
